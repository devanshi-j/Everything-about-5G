# Everything-about-5G

#Module 1
will cause wireless evolution

Steps to get started
1.once network designed
2. It gets deployed by service provider
3.Then it's checked one more time, for the need of optimisation. To derive the best user experience

* wireless communications & cellular networks

Basic concept states communication between transmiter and reciever without any physical contact.


1. Communication takes place by wireless channel, with the help of signals.
(Antena plays a major role to achive the above stated above.

* mostly every device can act transmitter & reciever both.

*Wireless signals (Radio frequency signals) 

#Radio signal properties

1.wireless signal travels at the speed of light ~ 300000 km /sec

2. Two main properties:
   I.frequency = speed of light/wavelength.
   It is the no. of repetition of radio       signals in 1 second. It is measured in     Hertz (Hz).
   RANGE: 3KHz-300GHz

   II. A wavelength fo measured in (m).       is the distance a wave travels to          complete a full cycle.
   RANGE: 100Km-1Mm

*frequency increases and wavelength decreaces. And Vica Versa.

NOTE: If 2 Radio Signals have same frequency they they will have same wavelength.

*Radio signals (electro magnetic signals)
also known as carrier waves.

* Modulation is to impose info, an the carrier waves. It can change certain atteributes like wavelength of the CW, this is how it imposes information onto the carrier. It can be analog  or digital

*demodulation is recovering the data from the reciever.

MODEM 
(MO = modulation, DEM = demodulation).

* what happens during, phone conversation; wireless transmission & reception

*While sending a message

VICA VERSA HAPPENS WHILE RECIEVEING A MESSAGE.

*While transfering of information it faces some challanges:
• Attenuates / Path loss transmission loss.
• Noise & interference

* In real time
  device 1 ➡️ ANTENA ➡️ device 2...

Noise & Interference (unwanted signals or energies..)

INTERGERENCE: delibrate form of disturbing energies. When 2 towers use the same redio frequency this happens.

NOISE: 
unwanted signal not delebrate. Already present in the device (Thermal noise).
It cannot be minimized after a certain level.

*Ambient noise (can be eliminated)

*To find a quatitative value

1.SNR Signal: Signal/Noise
(signal to noise ratio)

2. SINR: signal/ Noise + interference  (Signal tointerference & noise ratio).

# Radio Spectrum
is range of radio frequencies for which wireless connection takes place for a specific reason.

RANGE: 450 MHZ - 39 GHz
                   ⬇️
                 mmWave


*There are companies that assign transmission to different radio spectrums

# Radio channel and bandwidth

• when Phone transfers information, it just uses part of radio signal. It limited range of frequency known as its radio/frequency channel & its width is called bandwidth.

Radio Channel
1. narrowband: small amount of redio spectrum

2. Wideband: large amount of radio spectrum

Qs) why can't every every channel be wideband 
Ans. because of lack of avalibility, cause if radio spectrum is more then expence is also more.

*CDMA (Code division Multiple access)
2 ways of sharing
•TDD (Time division duplexing)
    A single radio channel is used, but       at different time. As speed of data       decreses, expences increase.
•FDD (Fequency division duplexing)
    two different channels are use to         communicate one is assigned tower         other your phone. But, It is              expensive and needs abundent radio 
    spectrum

* Factors affecting data rate
1.SNR
how good connectivity is shown by the bars.

2. How wide & crowded the channel is

3. How frequently abd efficiently the phone can utilize the channel, also known a spectral efficiency.

TOWERS = BASE STATION

* The cellular concept (main aim is to decrease dropped cells abd increase data rates and coverage area.)

According to the cellular concept mobile network coverage areas are divided into cells. According to geographical areas

• Hand off it states that you cellular tower changes, when your location changes.

If you are in a at low coverage area, it will affect your connection (known as dropped cells)

* what is cellular network

Services (email, Internet etc)
 ⬇️
Core network
It contains the data and also serves as the routing bridge between RAN & services.

Towers everywhere 
RAN - Radio Access Network

data reaches to phones...

# MODULE 2
How cellular communication are evolved over the years 1980's

1G- idea: people can recieve & make calls keeping aside there location. Done through analog modulation (anolog voice).

2G - 1990's - Idea: Same as 1G & also texts Started. Uses digital voice (digital modulation)

Advantages of using digital voica:
1.Compress
2.Reproduce & tramit digital sound

2000's - 3G idea - seamles access to internet

4G - when it came, the speed of data increased. But, it also expanded the eco system of gagets like Tabs, VR's ete, came into existance.

* 4G Use Cases.

every series, music etc (multimedia). is available to them everywhere.

Qs) But why do we need Something beyond 4G
Reason: Mainly to reduce latency & increased relibility

Also :
1. So that good network quality achieved when moving, or in conjusted environments.

2. So, to create a base of VR, 9r augmented reality.

3. Connect everyone & everything

*what changes will 5G bring?
                  ⬇️
             NR (New Radio)

1. significantly high data rates

2. Lower latency (reduction of delay)

3. Uniform experience

4. low cost per bit.

5. performanc will be increased by upto 10x.


* Services offered by 5G

1. EMBB (enhanced mobile broadband)

• improves spectral efficiency Bandwidth & power usage is secondary.

• which appd need it?

1 Peak user data > 10Gbps
2 Network throughout > 1Tbps

Macro cells significatly covers an area of few sq. 
→ Microcells & covers a Small ares

2. mMIC (massive machine type communications)

It an enables all eletric devices, to communicate with the network.
Massive I0T (Internet of things) can scale upto million devices. Also, does offer large coverage conditions

3.  URLLC ( ultre reliable Low latency communications)
necessary for mission critical services.
Empasis on E2E latency.

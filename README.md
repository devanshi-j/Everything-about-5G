# Everything-about-5G

#Module 1
will cause wireless evolution

Steps to get started
1.once network designed
2. It gets deployed by service provider
3.Then it's checked one more time, for the need of optimisation. To derive the best user experience

* wireless communications & cellular networks

Basic concept states communication between transmiter and reciever without any physical contact.


1. Communication takes place by wireless channel, with the help of signals.
(Antena plays a major role to achive the above stated above.

* mostly every device can act transmitter & reciever both


*Wireless signals (Radio frequency signals) 

#Radio signal properties

1.wireless signal travels at the speed of light ~ 300000 km /sec

2. Two main properties:
   I.frequency = speed of light/wavelength.
   It is the no. of repetition of radio       signals in 1 second. It is measured in     Hertz (Hz).
   RANGE: 3KHz-300GHz

   II. A wavelength fo measured in (m).       is the distance a wave travels to          complete a full cycle.
   RANGE: 100Km-1Mm

*frequency increases and wavelength decreaces. And Vica Versa.
